# GOLANG-TRANSLATION-practial-cpp20-finacial-programming

This repository provides a translation of key code examples from the book [*Practical C++20 Financial Programming* by Carlos Oliveira](https://github.com/Apress/practical-cpp20-financial-programming) into the Go programming language. The original book focuses on practical implementations of financial models and solutions using modern C++20 features. This project aims to reimplement these financial algorithms and concepts using Go, providing readers with the opportunity to explore financial programming through another powerful language with a different approach.

## Project Overview

The Go programming language, known for its simplicity and efficiency, provides a unique perspective when translating complex C++ code, especially when implementing financial calculations, simulations, and data structures. This project serves as both a companion to the original book and an independent exploration of financial programming using Go.

## Features

- **Code Translations**: Direct translations of key financial models and algorithms presented in the book.
- **Idiomatic Go**: Each translated example is written to adhere to Go’s idiomatic practices, providing insights into how Go handles certain constructs differently from C++.
- **Cross-Reference**: Source code includes comments that map Go implementations to their C++ counterparts, highlighting differences and offering guidance on migrating between the languages.
- **Financial Modeling**: Explore topics such as option pricing, numerical methods, risk analysis, and more within the Go ecosystem.
  
## Project Structure

The project structure mirrors the organization of the original C++20 codebase from the [Apress repository](https://github.com/Apress/practical-cpp20-financial-programming). Each chapter’s primary topics and examples are presented as Go files within relevant folders.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later (some of Go's latest features and improvements are utilized)
- Familiarity with basic Go development and Go modules

### Installation

To get started with the translated code examples:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevonErb/GOLANG-TRANSLATION-practial-cpp20-finacial-programming.git
   cd GOLANG-TRANSLATION-practial-cpp20-finacial-programming
2. Build and run any desired example using Go's built-in tools.
### Usage

Navigate to the directory for the example you want to run and use:

bash
go run example.go

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions, or wish to add more translations, feel free to create a pull request or submit an issue.

### License
I only made this for a job interview for payal, where they convert c++ to golang. so do whatever with it as long as it doenst conflict with the book and the linked github.
